        The Mantra has to be recited on a Rudhraksha mala and should be spoken in such a way that at least you can hear it. Shri Shiv Mahapuran is of the view that Rudhraksha does not give its full results without the use of proper mantras.
    </string>
    <string name="_rud_how_to_wear">
        The scared Rudhraksha that you have got is abhimantrit and empowered by Pankaj Khanna, so that it gives maximum results. This is ready to wear or can be kept in your place of worship and should be worn on a Monday morning before 7.30 a.m.
        \n\n
        To recharge it, you should take it off one week before Mahashivratri. Take a clean bowl and put the Rudraksha in it. Add Pure Desi Ghee in that bowl so that the Rudhraksha is properly immersed in it. Add some sandal wood powder, a bit of turmeric powder (Haldi) in that bowl. Leave it for a week’s time or more.
        \n\n
        Then on Mahashivratri day before 7.30 a.m. wash it with Ganga Jal mixed with saffron (kesar) and wear it after chanting the required mantra 108 times. Fasting on Mondays and Mahashivratri day will also be great help and improves the results from a Rudraksha.

    <string name="_rud_auth">
        The Mystic bead Rudhraksha is highly sacred to the Hindus of all castes / sects and regions. But as some of the Rudhraksha are very costly so some people out of greed try to tamper with the Rudhraksha so as to make them like a more costly member of the family.
        \n\n
        <b>Now, the question before the buyer is how he should check the authenticity of the Rudhraksha.</b>
        \n\n\n
        <b>1. EYE TEST:</b> Look at the bead all the mukhas / faces should look like joined lips and the partitions where the line is visible should be clear and look natural.
        \n\n
        <b>2. EYE GLASS:</b> Sometimes Rudhraksha are faked by removing the thorn like parts from one piece and then sticking it to another. This can be judged by a close examination by a 10x Lens.
        \n\n
        <b>3. WATER TEST:</b> Put the Rudhraksha in boiling water and let it remain there for 20 – 30 minutes. If some faces are tempered with them they shall come off as the glue – fevicol or the like will come off.
        \n\n
        <b>4. SCIENTIFIC TEST:</b> A botanical laboratory or a botanist can test a Rudhraksha and testify its originality. So, if in doubt take the Rudhraksha to a Botanical laboratory and know the facts.
    </string>
    <string name="_rud_faqs">
        <b>1. How can, this mystic power named Rudhraksha, be used by mankind for maximum benefit?</b>
        \n\n
        \tRudhraksha can either be worn in neck or it can be at a sacred place in house i.e., in the puja room or in front of God’s / Goddess’s idol or picture.
        \n\n
        <b>2. Should Rudhraksha be worn all the time?</b>
        \n\n
        \tIf one chooses to wear a Rudhraksha then he/she should wear it all the day and take off before going to bed. Then it should be worn again after the morning puja / prayers.
        \n\n
        <b>3. Can one eat non-vegetarian food and take alcohol if one is wearing Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \tThough taking non-vegetarian food and alcohol is not recommended to keep the Sanchit Karma pure but the Shiva sect of Hindu religion of which Rudhraksha is a symbol – does not prohibit it. So, one can take non-vegetarian food and take alcohol while wearing Rudhraksha.
        \n\n
        <b>4. What is the greatest use of Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \tRudhraksha beads regulate the blood pressure thus helping in controlling the thought process. This helps in Meditations which is the ultimate tool to realize the power of the inner self.
        \n\n
        <b>5. Does wearing Rudhraksha bring results?</b>
        \n\n
        \tThough one of the most sacred possessions of a Hindu – Rudhraksha does not lead to instant results but if worn over a period of time with complete faith and the required mantras are chanted regularly then the results promised by the Mahashiv Purana are surely achieved – this is what the sages say.
        \n\n
        <b>6. What is the cost of one Mukhi Round Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \tOne Mukhi Round Rudhraksha, which is said to have extraordinary powers is often heard of but such a piece is not seen in trade – I have never come across such a piece which is original, though I am trading in them since 1987.
        \n\n
        <b>7. How else can we get the benefits of Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \t(1) Rudhraksha can be kept in the place of worship.
        \n
        \t(2) One can dip seven beads of five Mukhi Rudhraksha in a glass of water and drink the water daily in the morning. This improves the blood circulation, gives one better concentration and the general nervous system in improved. The Rudhraksha beads have to be changed after every seven days.

    <string name="_rud_home">
    <b>Why Rudraksha - At the First Stage ?</b>\n\n\t
The human life is full of pain both on the physical as well as emotional level. Our ancient Rishis tried to search for cures for all ailments that effect us . These cures were in the form of Auyerveda , religion etc . But even with a healthy body and complete devotion to God man does not feel happy and to large extent all his efforts after fulfillment of basic bread and butter needs are aimed at searching for that happiness. He wanders in search of this happiness in Disco Thiks and nightclubs or else in Rishikesh or temples ………….. he tries to earn extraordinary money, be a leader but all this leaves a strange emptiness in him.
\n\n
Amid this position of turmoil Lord Shiva tells Goddess Parvati in Shiv Mahapuran that \" Now for the \' kalyan\' ( emancipation) of mankind I tell you about Rudraksha \" . Rudraksha , is said , to keep our blood pressure in a state of perfect equilibrium thus giving us tranquility and internal peace that helps us in achieving a level of emotional stability . Wearing of Rudraksha also helps us in meditation that is why ancient Rishis used to wear a number of Rudrakshas on their body in order to achieve the state of Samadhi easily and stay in it for a long duration.
\n\n
Rudrakshas help us in achieving a balance and improves our mental faculties .

<b>What is the Unique Advantage of Rudraksha ?
\n\n
How Pankaj Khanna\'s Rudraksha\'s different ?</b>
        \n\tPankaj Khanna has been in the trade of Rudrakshas since 1987. The Rudraksha sold by him are collected from deep jungles through the length and breadth of Himalayas . Once collected they are thoroughly checked for originality, quality and efficacy. After this they are stored in accordance with the dicta\'s of the scriptures . Before sending it to the customer Pankaj Khanna himself empowers it with mantras and then in the most pious way it is packed and then dispatched to the customer in a ready to wear form.
\n\n
<b>Who can wear Rudrakshas ?</b>\n\n\t
All human beings can wear a Rudraksha without any restriction of race or gender.
\n\n
<b>After buying the product - What is the process to wear it ?</b>
        \n\n\t
The scared Rudhraksha that you have got is abhimantrit and empowered by Pankaj Khanna, so that it gives maximum results. This is ready to wear or can be kept in your place of worship and should be worn on a Monday morning before 7.30 a.m.
\n\n
To recharge it, you should take it off one week before Mahashivratri. Take a clean bowl and put the Rudraksha in it. Add Pure Desi Ghee in that bowl so that the Rudhraksha is properly immersed in it. Add some sandal wood powder, a bit of turmeric powder (Haldi) in that bowl. Leave it for a week\'s time or more.
\n\n
Then on Mahashivratri day before 7.30 a.m. wash it with Ganga Jal mixed with saffron (kesar) and wear it after chanting the required mantra 108 times. Fasting on Mondays and Mahashivratri day will also be great help and improves the results from a Rudraksha.

    <string name="ittr_about">
        <b>Ittar</b>\n\n
The word ittar or attar is basically an Arabic word which means scent,this in turn has been derived from the Persian word Atr,meaning fragrance. Attar is a natural perfume oil derived from botanical sources. Most commonly these oils are taken from the botanical material through hydro or steam distillation. Oils can also be expressed by chemical means but generally natural perfumes which qualify as Ittar/Attars are distilled naturally. The oils obtained from the herbs flowers and wood are generally distilled into a wood base such as sandalwood and then aged. The aging period can last from one to ten years depending on the botanicals used and the results desired.
\n
These all-natural perfumes are highly concentrated and therefore are usually offered for sale in small quantities and have traditionally been offered in decorated crystal cut type bottles or small jeweled decanters. Attars/Ittars have been used in the entire Eastern world for thousands of years. These 100% pure and natural perfumes are free of alcohol and chemicals. Natural perfumes are affordable because they are so concentrated that a small bottle will last the user several weeks, if not months. Due to the purity and the nature of oils, there is very little chance of spoilage .
\n
Some of the first lovers of Attars/Ittars were the Mughal nobles of India. Jasmine ittar was the favorite perfume of the Nizams of the Hyderabad state. Traditionally in the Eastern world it was a customary practice of nobility to offer ittar to their guests at the time of their departure. The Attars/Ittars are traditionally given in ornate tiny crystal cut bottles called as itardans. This tradition of giving a scent to one\'s guests continues to this day in many parts of the Eastern world. Among Sufi worshipers the use of Attars/Ittars during meditation circles and dances is quite common.

        Buying Birthstones is a not a very easy task for a layman as the Quality and Originality of Birthstones is something which is difficult to assess for any person who is not a trained Gemologist.
        \n\n
Now let us try to understand these two points in detail:
\n\n
The quality of Gemstones implies the three things:
\n\n
<b>1.\tColour:\t</b> The colour of a Birthstone is the most important factor. More eye pleasing and vibrant the colour of a Gemstone more is its price and simultaneously more is its effect.
\n\n
<b>2.\tClarity\t</b>: The transparency is a very important factor that differentiates between a Stone and a Birthstone. To be effective a Birthstone has to be transparent so that it absorbs the cosmic rays in full strength and transfers it in the body of the wearer. More transparent the Birthstone better is its effect.
\n\n
<b>3.\tLuster:\t</b> Shine and a feeling as if a coloured light is emitting out of a Gemstone is a sign of Quality a Value for a Birthstone. You can feel this Green Light coming out of Emerald (Panna Stone), Red or Pinkish light emitting out of Ruby(Manik Stone), Blue light coming out of Blue Sapphire(Neelam Stone), Yellow light coming out of a Yellow Sapphire(Pukhraj Stone).
\n\n
Originality of Birthstone is even more important because if the Birthstone is not original then all other factors are of nil value.
\n\n
To determine weather a Birthstone is original is not possible for a lay man so the only solution available is to buy from <b>Gem Selections, Janakpuri, New Delhi where you will get a Certificate of Originality from the Gemological Laboratory of Indian Gemological Institute, under the Ministry of Commerce, Govt. of India.</b>

\n\n
When the ring/pendent is ready bring it home and dip it in pure desi ghee. On the day prescribed for that Gem take it out from the bowl containing ghee and wash it with warm Ganga Jal mixed with Saffron and wear it after chanting the prescribed mantras before 7.00 AM.

The most effective substitute for natural sapphire are Golden Topaz, Iolite, Kyanite, Tourmaline, Blue Spinel and Synthetic Sapphire, and methods for detecting the differences between the natural and the manufactured stone needs to be discussed.
\n\n
Golden Topaz, Iolite, Kyanite, Tourmaline and Blue Spinel are much light in weight so it is not very difficult to differentiate between these Gemstones and a Sapphire, especially if these are in loose form. The difficulty arises when one is faced with a Synthetic Gemstone.
\n\n
With the market full of Gemstones which look like a Sapphire
\n\n
The First step in testing a sapphire like -blue Gemstone is to measure its Refractive Index on a standard Refractometer, using sodium light or a good colour filter. Where readings of 1.76-1.77 are visible the stone must be either a natural or a synthetic sapphire.
\n\n
The second step is to check with a 20x magnifying glass and analyze its inclusions if the inclusions have natural character and features then a Gemmologist can be nearly certain that the Gemstone in front of him is a natural Stone. .
\n\n
Remember that for distinction of natural from synthetic sapphire, the physical tests like Refractive Index or Specific Gravity do not help the Gemologist. The most reliable test involves an examination of the internal features of the stone. With sapphire, mere inspection with the naked eye is sometimes sufficient if the stone be immersed in a liquid such as 1-bromonaphthalene and viewed against a white background. In fact an egg-cup full of water will often suffice to show the distribution of colour, in the natural stones such banding is straight in zones.
\n\n
Natural stones almost invariably carry within them clear signs of their slow crystallization in an environment consisting of chemically complex liquors and mineralizing agents. It is only to be expected that some of the substances surrounding the growing crystals should become impounded and remain preserved within the sapphire as frozen witnesses for our interrogation years later. These positive signs, included in natural sapphires, apart from the straight zones of colour already mentioned, vary somewhat according to the locality where the sapphire was mined.
\n\n
<b>Sri Lankan sapphires</b> contain typical ‘feathers’ consisting of layers of minute crystalline or liquid inclusions which reflect light from one plane often slightly curved, like a thumb or fingerprint. However, feathers of similar appearance occur in many of the flux-grown synthetic sapphires. Whereas in natural stones the ‘droplets of the feathers contain liquid, synthetic feathers consist of particles of solid flux with or without gas in the cavities. Examination by reflected light assists in the elucidation of the nature of the droplets and may also reveal the presence of shiny crystals of platinum which are sometimes seen in the flux-grown material. Other typical features of Sri Lankan sapphires are rounded crystals of zircon, showing high relief and surrounded by crack-like tension haloes three-phase inclusions containing liquid, a movable gas bubble, and well-shaped crystals of hematite or other minerals are also not uncommon in Sri Lankan sapphires. A form of long fine silk is also common in Sri Lankan Gemstones, but these and Burma stones may show both coarse and fine and long and short crystals. Sapphire of basaltic origin (Thai, Cambodian, Australian, and some other corundum) may contain crystals of Garnet, and Feldspar are seen in Thai and Cambodian (Pailin) stones.
\n\n
<b>Thai Sapphires</b> resemble Thai rubies in frequently containing opaque crystals (some are pyrochlore) surrounded by a disc-shaped lacy leather. Hexagonal growth structures occur in many sapphires, but those from Australia and Montana show them well: it must be remembered, however, that these hexagonal structures have also been seen in the synthetics.
\n\n
<b>Kashmir sapphires</b> owe their attractive milkiness to minute liquid or exsolved inclusions often in hazy bands and nebulous clouds.
\n\n
With larger inclusions the host may disintegrate under the strain. Negative inclusions containing fluids crack and any liquid leaks out and may help to partially re-heal the tension fissures which have formed. These and other features can be detected by careful microscopic examination. Melted inclusions surrounded by tension halos are a characteristic feature of many treated rubies and sapphires.
\n\n
By heating corundum in alumina powder with varying proportions of colouring agents (iron and titanium for blue sapphires, chromium for ruby, and iron with chromium for orange sapphires) it is possible to diffuse extra colour into a pre-formed or faceted stone. The temperatures and time involved may be in the 1800*C region for 24 hours.

Our physical body is enveloped by an Energy Body which the Veda\'s referred to as AURA. This Aura is found around living as well as non living objects. You can feel this Aura and even measure it certain instruments available in the market. Our conscious and sub conscious mind along with our nervous system and other vital organs are greatly influenced by this AURA.
\n\n
The Gemstones have a strong Aura and are a ready source of Colours that are present in the cosmic rays of the planets and the Aura.
\n\n
The Aura around Humans is greatly influenced by the Cosmic Rays which are attracted by the Gemstones and then passed on to Human bodies.
\n\n
By wearing Gemstones, we start the process of absorbing additional Cosmic rays of Gemstones so that our Aura starts changing. When our Aura changes – there are changes in our thought process as well as changes in the way people perceive us and our actions.
\n\n
Wearing the Gemstones that are favourable for you will improve your AURA the people that come in contact with you will start having a different impression about you. This process will always lead to better standing in the Society, Company, Family and so on.?

        Gemstones are extremely expensive and it is very difficult to differentiate between genuine and fake gemstones. At the same time, there are many unscrupulous elements out there who cheat unsuspecting people by selling them fake stones or blemished stones at exorbitant prices. This is the reason it is necessary to be very careful when you BUY GEMS. Always buy gemstones from a reputed and respected jeweler. At the same time, if you buy gemstones in India, you should always insist on a certificate proving that they are genuine and that they are worth the amount that is being charged to you. These certificates are provided by reputed and reliable organizations and they are ample proof of the quality of the gemstones.
\n\n
When people buy gems each person has their own preferences, some people prefer stones that have a perfect cut, while others simply go for the gemstones which are brilliant in color and clarity. Some occasions like weddings demand that the gemstones used in the jewelry should complement the ensemble as a whole. There are other parameters as well on the basis of which gemstones are distinguished. The precious gemstones are the best and the most expensive. These gemstones have always been the preference of connoisseurs and are exquisite. It is quite difficult to buy these gemstones at an affordable price whether you buy gemstones in India or anywhere in the world.
\\n
The precious and exquisite gemstones are usually reserved to be flaunted on special occasions. The color, clarity and cut of such gemstones are perfect and it is quite difficult to find such gemstones in the market. However, semi precious stones also have a charm of their own. So if you want to BUY GEMS but cannot afford the precious stones, you can opt for the semi precious stones. These stones can be as beautiful and attractive as the precious stones. The only problem is that most of the times the color, texture and cut of these semi precious stones might not really be at par with the precious stones. However, if you have a limited budget these might prove to be a good idea if you buy gemstones in India or elsewhere.
\n\n
It is always best to opt for Natural Gemstones because these will remain valuable for a long time to come. There are artificial options to choose from as well but you may not be completely satisfied with the quality of these artificial stones. However, whatever your choice may be always opt for the best quality of gemstones and do not settle for a low quality if you can afford it.
\n\n
Nowadays it is possible to BUY GEMS of good quality, both precious as well as semi precious stones online. There are many reliable online stores that sell good quality gemstones and provide the necessary certification which proves the quality of gemstones if you buy gemstones in India or anywhere else. All you need to do is conduct some research on the internet and you will be able to find a number of options which will help you to compare different sites and their offers and help you to make an informed decision.
\n\n
<b>Buying a Gem is not an easy process as most of the people do not know much about Gems. Either their knowledge is from hear say or from sources that are not authentic. Before you go out to buy a Gemstone do the required home work:
</b>
        \n\n\t
1. Decide the weight of the Gem in advance.\n\t
2. Select a Shop that specializes in Gems and do not buy from Pundits or Goldsmiths.\n\t
3. Find out weather the Shop owners are Gemologists or simply traders buying from someone – not knowing what they buy and selling it to trusting customers.
\n\t4. Take a formal bill with VAT/ Sales Tax details.
\n\t5. Try to gain some knowledge from some authentic books about the Gem.
\n\t6. Real Gemstones are valuable and you will need to spend a good amount on them.
\n\n
When you actually go to buy a Gemstone you should see the following factors:
\n\n
\t<b>A. Clarity:</b> When you BUY GEMS the clarity is a very important criterion. A clear Gemstone is Rare in nature and because of its rareness it is costly. Precious Gemstones that do not have any inclusions even under 30X magnification are rare and are very highly priced.
\n\t<b>B. Size:</b> A gemstone above 500mg size are costly and those that are above 2.2gm are very costly. The reason is again the same – rarity – and demand and Supply.
\n\t<b>C. Luster:</b> A stone to come in the category of a Precious Gem should have LUSTER. The more lustrous a GEM – rarer it is and hence more costly.
\n\t<b>D. Colour: </b>The colour is a very important criterion. The colour should be eye pleasing.

        How to identify sapphire?
    </string>
    <string name="faq10">
        If you want to buy gemstones you need to be really careful because a lot of people can dupe you with inferior quality gemstones. Also when you plan to buy gems, you should always buy natural gemstones. This is because although artificial gemstones are easily available in the market and they are cheaper that natural gemstones, they just don’t have the sparkle and brilliance that natural gemstones do. Instead of buying artificial gemstones it will be a good idea to buy semi precious stones which may not be as good and exquisite as the real stones but they are at least the real thing.
\n\n
When you buy gemstones you should keep in mind that natural gemstones are nature’s gift to mankind. They are taken out of the earth by mining process. Most people have this misconception that natural gemstones are exorbitantly priced, but that is not the case. The price of gemstones is decided based on the quality, desirability and availability. When you buy natural gemstones you should keep in mind that certain gemstones are sold at affordable rates because they are abundantly available in nature. The quality of a gemstone is determined keeping in mind its color and brilliance and the number of inclusions it has.
\n\n
Natural gemstones are often subjected to certain physical and chemical treatments to enhance their beauty. For instance if gemstones are subjected to radiation and heat, their appearance improve tremendously. Some jewelers use different oils and wax to fill up the inclusions in a gemstone. This technique is widely used with rubies and emeralds. If subjected to diffusion the color of the gemstone deepens. You should avoid buying these treated gemstones, however, if you are on a tight budget then you can buy gemstones that have been treated with these methods. Again some people believe that all gemstones are treated to some degree or the other and it is not correct to classify them as treated or untreated. However, you should also keep this factor in mind when you buy natural gemstones.
\n\n
Now the question is where to find natural gemstones. Usually the reputed and well established jewelers stock natural gemstones of good quality. You should avoid buying gemstones from stores which have a tarnished or questionable reputation. At the same time, you should always insist upon a certificate that proves the genuineness and quality of the stone, because these certificates are provided by reputed and trustworthy organizations. Apart from buying natural gemstones from regular brick and mortar stores, you can also find good quality natural gemstones in online stores.
\n\n
These online stores, have a reputation of their own and they provide client testimonials which give you an idea about their reliability. At the same time you have a lot of choice on the internet to compare the prices offered by different stores and choose the ones that appear to be the most reasonable. Many of these online stores also provide certifications from reliable bodies that prove the quality and genuineness of the stones. Hence you can rest assured that you will not be cheated.

        Yantras can be defined as visual mantras which have been used since the days of Yajur Veda and Brahminical Text to remove the malefic effects of certain evil forces (Rakshisi Shakti) and to Strengthen the positive forces (Davik Shakti)

Emerald Cabochon is like all coloured gemstone. We can say that there is four type of gems find Color, Cut, Clarity and Crystal. Emerald (Be3Al2Si6O18) is the grass-green type of Beryl. The formation of emerald involves a natural process known as exometamorphism.
\n\n
Traditional gemstone for the astrological signs of Taurus, Cancer and sometimes Gemini. One of the quainter anecdotes on emeralds was by the 16th-century historian Brantôme, who referred to the many impressive emeralds the Spanish under Cortez had brought back to Europe from Latin America.
\n\n
Normally, in the grading of colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of emerald, crystal is considered a close second. Both are necessary conditions. A fine emerald must possess not only a pure verdant green hue as described below, but also a high degree of transparency to be considered a top gem.
\n\n
The Swat emeralds show light red to red through the Chelsea color filter and completely absorb short-wave ultra-violet radiation.
\n\n

Brazil Panna is of grass - green colour. Value of Brazil Panna depends on its Colour, Transparency and Luster.
\n\n
Normally, in the grading of colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of Emerald, transparency is considered a close second. Both are necessary conditions. A fine Panna must possess not only a pure vibrant green hue, but also a high degree of transparency to be considered a top Gem.
\n\n
Emeralds have been held in high esteem since ancient times. For that reason, some of the most famous emeralds are to be seen in museums and collections.
\n\n
Green of the Emerald is a colour which conveys harmony and love of Nature.
\n\n
Property of Emerald, the Refractive Index and SG vary perceptibly according to the locality where it is mined, due to variations in chemical composition. These inclusions, also, are often distinctive for each locality, and Gemologists will do well to familiarize themselves with these things if they wish to distinguish between the Emeralds of one mine from another.
\n\n
Color is divided into three components: Hue, Saturation and Tone. The hue must be bright. Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in Emerald. A grayish green hue is a dull green. Brazil has been supplying Emeralds to the world market since the 1980s. Typical Brazilian emeralds are Lighter and Yellowish. Emeralds from Zimbabwe are smaller is size and lighter in shade. However the term \'African emerald\' is a misnomer. It simply denotes Green Fluorite. The presence of chromium in emerald is the absorption spectrum it displays, which is distinctive enough to enable the stone to be distinguished from any other gem species.
\n\n
Emerald should, strictly speaking, perhaps not exist at all. But during intensive tectonic processes such as orogenesis, metamorphism, emergences and erosion of the land, these contrasting elements found each other and crystallised out to make one of our most beautiful gemstones.
\nThe Swat emeralds show light red to red through the Chelsea color filter and completely absorb short-wave ultra-violet radiation.
\n\n
This gives the rock its gemlike green color. Varying amount of iron also alters the color of the rock. It has a hardness of 7.5-8 and a refractive index of 1.57-1.59. However it is not a gem recommended for \'everyday\' use since it falls in the category of soft stone.

Emeralds are also cut in many other, mainly classical shapes, but if the raw material contains a large number of inclusions, it may often be cut into a gently rounded cabochon, or into one of the emerald beads which are so popular in India.
\n\n
So how can you protect yourself from these \'fakes\'? best way is to buy from a specialist in whom you have confidence. Emerald should only be purchased with a report from a reputable gemological institute. You can differentiate reliably between natural and synthetic emeralds.

It is imperative that a blue sapphire or neelam be worn after consultation. Before asking you to wear a blue sapphire or neelam the person recommending it to you will also ask you to test it. Let us discuss how neelam can be tested before actually wearing it.
\n\n
A neelam stone can be worn in ear rings, a finger ring or even as a pendant in a chain. We have already discussed how to recognize a genuine neelam and the points to watch out for while buying a neelam.
\n\n
Wearing a blue sapphire protects against danger, travel problems, terror, thieves, accidents.
        \n\n
It can cause financial fortunes to change for the better, help with a person\'s career, and make the wearer rich. It can free one of mental anxiety.
\n\n
It helps make one detached, and protects against envy. It can be worn for good luck and for protection against evil spirits.
\n\n
Neelam stone\'s are found in India, Burma, Ceylon, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Brazil and Africa. From the gemstone mines, the raw crystals are first taken to the cutting-centres where they are turned into sparkling gemstones by skilled hands.
\n\n
The most valuable are genuine Kashmir stones. Burmese sapphires are valued almost as highly, and then come the sapphires from Ceylon. The possibility of the gemstone\'s having undergone some treatment or other is also a factor in determining the price,
\n\n
The fact that this magnificent gemstone also comes in a large number of other colours was known for a long time almost only to insiders. In the trade, sapphires which are not blue are referred to as \'fancies\'.
\n\n
The presence of small amounts of other elements, especially iron and chrome, are responsible for the colouring, turning a crystal that was basically white into a blue, red, yellow, pink or greenish sapphire. However, this does not mean that every corundum is also a sapphire.
\n\n
Thus the blue of the sapphire has become a colour which fits in with everything that is constant and reliable. That is one of the reasons why women in many countries wish for a sapphire ring on their engagement. The sapphire symbolises loyalty, but at the same time it gives expression to people\'s love and longing.

Pukhraj Stone is a more-or-less yellow variety of corundum. It was also formerly known as \"oriental topaz\".Pukhraj Stone may be found in a wide variety of colours from pale to canary yellow, gold, honey and brownish yellow. The lighter, brighter colours are more common than dark, dull colours. Like all corundum pukhraj stone have considerable amount of luster. Medium-sized or large stones are often seen, generally with a mixed round cut. Honey-coloured pukhrajstone are less common, smaller, equally lustrous and are given both oval and rectangular step cuts. Natural High Value Pukhraj
\n\n
Like all corundum, Pukhraj Stone can be distinguished from other gems by its luster but not from yellow chrysoberyl, which is very similar in this respect. Yellow zircon has luster similar to that of pukhraj but is usually distinguishable through a lens by its much larger birefringence, the facet edges appearing much more clearly duplicated and both facets and edges giving an impression of less hardness and greater brittleness. The inclusions in pukhrajstone are also fairly characteristic, at least when viewed through a lens. All in all, however, many yellow gems show resemblance to pukhrajstone and must, therefore be distinguished by their physical properties.
\n\n
<b><u>Occurrence</u></b>
\n\n
Most light or canary Pukhraj Stone comes from Sri Lanka and only a small propotion from Australia, which, however, supplies most of the less common honey, golden yellow or yellow-brown stones. Limited quantities are obtained from Burma.
\n\n
Somewhat surprisingly, even very attractive pukhrajs with fine luster are of relatively less value compared with other secondary gems; they are, for example, worth a lot less than the pink variety.
\n\n
Pukhraj Stone was never really imitated by other substances until synthetic corundum was first ever produced.Since then canary and honey-yellow varieties have been widely manufactured. Like pink and colorless synthetic corundum, the yellow variety produced by the Verneuil flame fusion method is highly convincing and harder to distinguish from its natural counterparts than are rubies and sapphires produced in this way.
\n\n
<b><u>Physical Properties of Pukhraj Gemstone:-</u></b>
\n\n
<b>Properties of Pukhrajcan be defined by:</b>
\n\n\t
<u>Color</u>
\n\n\t\t
Pukhraj Stone is commonly found in a range of hues between greenish yellow and orangish yellow. Deep pure golden yellow without any trace of orange is considered to be the best color for a Pukhraj Stone. Sometimes the yellow color of the stone can be so pale that it can fall into the category of a white sapphire.
\n\n\t\t
Like all colours, yellow covers a huge range. From natural pastel light yellow and lemon yellow, to the deep orangy yellow or golden yellow, all are magnificent. The most sought after yellow, is a medium vibrant canary. The brighter and purer the yellow color, the more valuable the pukhraj is.
\n\n\t\t
Pukhraj Stone comes in Many Different Shades.The main causes of yellow coloration in Pukhraj Stone is the trace of element iron. In general, increased iron concentrations will tend produce higher color saturation, leading to a richer and more vibrant color.
\n\n\t\t
One should always check a Pukhraj’s Report to Make Sure It Is a genuine gemstone as Pukhraj Stone can also be colored enhanced by lab-induced irrradiation. Irradiated pukhrajs are not dangerous, but their color has been known to fade with exposure to heat and light. A treated gemstone also loses its astrological powers.
\n\n\t
<u>Cut</u>
\n\n\t\t
Pukhraj Stone is quite commonly discovered in oval cut to retain maximum weight.But is too cut and faceted into a lot of frequent and fancy shapes like cushion cut, round, octagonal, square and so on.
\n\n\t\t
The cut is the main factor affecting your sapphire’s sparkle. If the cut is poor it will look dull and lifeless. Cut does not refer to the shape of the stone, rather the facets on the gem’s surface, which allow light and color to shine through at their best.
\n\n\t\t
Pukhraj Stone rough has traditionally been less costly than blues or pinks, so cutters don’t compromise brilliance in favor of weight retention. As a result, well-cut pukhrajs are easier to find than other sapphire colors and are more readily available in specialty cuts. A good cut is especially crucial if the stone color is light.
\nDark gemstones can look lively and dramatic, even if the cut is not perfect. However, with light or colorless gemstones, the stone’s ability to reflect light is very important.
\n\n\t\t
Because pukhraj is very hard, jewelers typically cut it into complex shapes with crisp edges
\n\t\tSofter yellow glass may feature simple cuts with rounded edges
\n\t\tWhile smaller pukhrajs may be cut into any style, stones that are more than one carat typically feature oval or cushioned mixed cuts
\n\t\tLarge synthetic pukhrajs often feature popular round or emerald cuts
\n\t\tAvoid X cuts or ridges on facets
\n\t\tSynthetic stones may feature an X or "scissors cut" on their facets
\n\t\tSynthetic stones may have grooves on facets
\n\n\t
<u>Ratti</u>
\n\n\t\t
Ratti is the unit of weight by which a gemstone is measured. Because large gemstones are found less commonly than small ones, the price of a gemstone raises exponentially to its size [It follows the law of demand and supply]. The price of pukhraj (or any other stone for that matter) is expressed as per ratti.
\n\n\t
<u>Clarity</u>
\n\n\t\t
Prominently visible or even faint natural inclusions for example feathers, colour zoning, crystals and so on are typically discovered in pukhraj.A sapphire with no inclusions is often viewed with suspicion; it may be a synthetic stone or a glass imitation. It’s important to check that there is genuine documentation for the stone you are purchasing.
\n\n\t\t
The best clarity grade for sapphires is Perfection, which means it is completely clear to the naked eye, ‘eye-clean’. Pukhraj tend to have fewer inclusions than other colors. What are inclusions? Inclusions are a natural consequence of crystal growth and even the best stones are not expected to be totally inclusion free.
\n\n\t\t
Pukhraj Stone are found in Tanzania, Madagascar, Thailand and Australia, although Sri Lanka is the primary source. While many of our customers worry about how origin might affect the value of their sapphire, with pukhrajs the mining origin doesn’t affect the price.
\n\n\t
<b>The Price</b>
\n\n\t\t
If you were considering a yellow diamond ring and were put off by the daunting price tag then pukhrajs are the right choice for you. You may well find a beautiful comparable sapphire that is within your price range. The price of pukhraj generally available in the market ranges from Rs 450 to Rs 51,000.
\n\n\t
<b><u>Heat Treatment</u></b>
\n\n\t\t
Traditional heating is widely used for pukhrajs. This process can enhance the color and transparency of some stones, and the changes made are permanent. They are much rarer and consequently hold greater value.
\n\n\t\t
As with all sapphires, they are incredibly tough and scratch resistant, and rate 9 on the Mohs scale (the third hardest mineral, right behind diamond at 10 and moissanite at 9.25)
\n\n\n
<u>
<b>How to Check the Purity of Pukhraj</b></u>
\n\n
Pukhraj Stone is an eye-catching gem, which provides a unique color and sparkle to engagement rings and other elegant jewelry. These sunny yellow stones look great in both traditional gold and white gold settings. They also hold special meanings in certain spiritual disciplines. When selecting a pukhrajs, shoppers must ensure they are getting an authentic stone so that they do not overpay for a synthetic replica. Shoppers can scour jewelry stores, or estate and consignment shops for pukhrajjewelry. A more convenient alternative is buying from eBay, an online auction destination with jewels available around-the-clock, 365 days each year. Before buying, shoppers should understand facts about genuine pukhrajs, and how to discern imitation stones.
\n\n\t
<b>Basic Facts about Authentic Pukhraj Stone</b>
\n\n
Pukhraj Stone belong to the corundum family of gemstones. Corundum is pure aluminum oxide, which crystallizes at high temperatures and pressures to form stones. Most gemstones in the corundum family are sapphires, except for purplish red to yellow red varieties, known asrubies, and rare pink-orange stones called Padparadscha. While the most popular sapphires are blue, these stones also come in other vivid colors including pink, green, and yellow.
\n\n
Sapphires are very hard gemstones. They rank at nine on the Moh\'s hardness scale, which makes them second in hardness only to diamonds, which rank at ten on the same scale. As a result, sapphires very rarely display any scratches on their surfaces. Pukhrajs, also called pukhraj , feature a very pure yellow, with no green or orange tinges.
\n\n<b><u>Synthetic Pukhraj</u></b>
\n\n
When sapphire is found in the nature and is only cut and polished by machine/ man, without any other interference to enhance or edit its physical properties, it is considered to be natural. When the same chemical, physical and molecular composition is recreated by man, the new product is known as Synthetic Pukhraj.
\n\n
Chemically and physically the stone tests the same as its natural counterpart unless very high level testing is conducted or some visual \'imperfections\' or indications of synthetic building of the stone are present. Here, proper certification of the gemstone becomes a must before buying Pukhraj. We at Gem Selections get all our gemstones certified from Government Lab before keeping the gemstones in our inventory.
\n\n
<b><u>Imitation of a Pukhraj:</u></b>
\n\n\t
The imitation stone of a Pukhraj Stone is the one that will \'look\' like a real pukhraj but it is essentially not the same in chemical or molecular structure. Anything including a glass, plastic, other natural/ synthetic stones, some non-precious stones etc can be used for imitation stones.
\n\n
The hardness, the refractive index, the look and definitely the price will differ between a pukhraj and its imitation. Imitation stones are usually used for visual appeal and cost saving only. These can be as inexpensive as a piece of glass or as expensive as a yellow diamond.
\n\n
<b>Treated Pukhraj:</b>
\n\n
This is probably the biggest challenge when trying to predict the value of your pukhraj. Treatments can be temporary in which case they wear off over a period of time or they can be permanent, in which case the chemical or molecular changes are permanent.
\n\n
Treatments are done on stones to enhance the color, clarity, value or sometimes to create homogenetity. This is a fair enough practice as long as it is declared clearly so that you pay only for what you are buying and no more.
\n\n
        <u><b>
How to \'see\' the difference between a Pukhraj and any other stone:</b></u>
        \n\n

Essentially, it is very difficult for a person without sufficient gemological experience to distinguish between a synthetic Pukhraj Stone and a real one and in most cases even an imitation. However, by process of elimination, you can fairly well rule out any misnomers and imitations.
\n\n
<b><u>9 Effective Ways to Identify a Real Pukhraj Stone</u></b>

Nonetheless, it consists few inclusions, but they can hardly be seen with the naked eyes. Hence, if you spot anything like liquid flowing inside the stone or bubbles with bare eyes. So that is a clear indication that the stone is not original.
\n\n\t
Check for Scratches: Pukhraj Stone is a rigid stone. The stone is extensively hard and the hardness of the stone measures 9.0 on moh scale. Therefore, after purchasing a pukhraj try to scrub it against a hard material, unfortunately if it gets scratches then it a fake pukhraj.

With bare eyes it is very difficult to check this perhaps with the help of magnifier one can easily check this.
\n\n\t
Stay away from X sign: If Pukhraj Stone encompasses X-sign on the back of the stone. Then, it sends a clear indication that the stone is fake. Therefore, while buying pukhraj do consider this sign on the stone subtly if you spot this stone, then do not buy that pukhraj stone.
\n\n\t
Avoid Grooves: Occasionally, the facets of synthetic stones do not come out as crisp as the facets of a natural sapphire would. This flaw looks very similar to the grooves one might expect to see on a vinyl record, but they can usually be seen only under magnification of a 10x loupe.
\n\n\t
Check for Flaws: Whether it’s a natural pukhraj it encompasses few inclusions that can be barely seen with the naked eyes. However, while investing this stone under a magnifier you would see these inclusions. Nonetheless, if you see a gemstone which is included free then don’t buy that stone because it is impossible to find a pure pukhraj.
        \n\n\t
Warmer than original stone: To check that whether a Pukhraj Stone is natural or fake. One should perform this action, he/she should hold a piece of pukhraj in his/her hand and if stone feels warm to you then it is a natural pukhraj. Instead of that, if sapphire does not feel anything than it is clear indication that the stone is synthetic.
\n\n

<b><u>Why is a Pukhraj Stone is more expensive than most colored stones</u></b>
\n\n\t
• Because of its astrological demand. Not only is pukhraj suggested to most believers for good health, temperament and other positive personal enrichment, but also it is one stone which astrologically does not harm any wearer. The demand is very high for good quality pukhraj
\n\t• Rarity: In good color and good clarity, pukhraj is a fairly rare stone especially in larger sizes that are usually recommended by astrologers.
\n\t• It belongs to the Corundum family. Technically, a pukhraj is pukhraj, or the \'yellow\' colored stone from the corundum family of gemstones. When this stone is red in color it is called "Ruby", when it is blue then it is called "Sapphire", when it is orange it is called "Padprasha" and any other color is denoted by the color name - sapphire ,eg purple sapphire, pink sapphire, green sapphire etc.
\n\t• Corundum is 9 on the Moh\'s scale of hardness which makes it very good for everyday wear
\n\t• It is a gorgeous stone which looks rich and elegant. It has been given a lot of credit by designers over a period of time which only enhances its value
\n\n
        <b><u>PUKHRAJ AND ASTROLOGY</u></b>
\n\n
An unblemished Pukhraj Stone gives the wearer good health, wisdom, property, longevity, name, honours, and fame. The wearer is blessed with children and grandchildren. It affords protection from evil spirits. It is believed that if there are obstructions in getting a suitable match for a girl, she gets married early by wearing a pukhraj.
\n\n
Blemished gemstones are the cause of many troubles. A stone with cracks invites threats of theft. One without luster and transparency creates enemies and causes disharmony in the family. Milky stone invites injuries to the body. The one with a web causes stomach disorders. The stone with black and white colours is harmful for the cattle of the wearer. The one with red dots on it destroys wealth. The stone with a depression causes anxiety and disturbs peace of mind.

Taking advantage of the ignorance of the people – most of the Jewellers, Astrologers and Pundits sell TREATED Yellow Sapphire/ Pukhraj and earn huge profits by misguiding the trusting customers.

The process of Treating any Gemstone involves heating it to a very high temperature and then infusing artificial colour in them. This process transforms a low grade Gemstone into a good looking piece which can fetch a good price in the market.

    <string name="pukhraj_astro">
Pukhraj Astrology may seem to be a strange nomenclature but it implies that stream of astrology on the basis of which Pukhraj Stone should be worn. Pukhraj Astrology is very popular in India as the Pukhraj is the Gemstone that is mostly worn in India it is worn for n number of reasons – for timely marriage, comfortable marriage, health, wealth, status, spiritual life and so on.
\n\n
No other country uses Pukhraj Stone or Yellow Sapphire to such a great extent. Like Gold, Pukhraj is also mined in many countries but consumed mostly in India. This is the reason why Pukhraj Astrology is most popular in India.
\n\n
<b>First House:</b> Jupiter placed in the first house i.e., Ascendant is a very favourable position. It will confer rank, authority, respect, wealth and long life. The person is quite social, loved by his friends, popular within the family, will be courageous and make donations. He will gain from import and export. He gets substantial inheritance, is loved and respected by wife/husband. Wearing a good Pukhraj Stone protects from the evil designs of the enemies and furthers the positive traits of Jupiter.
\n\n
<b>Second House:</b> Learned, intelligent, has command over many languages, scholar. Liquid assets are of high order. He gains from business, industry and politics. Jupiter here is eighth from seventh house – this position can lead to extra marital relations or relations that are not sanctioned by society. Disturbances in family life, too much indulgence leading to loss of health etc are regular problems resulting from this position of Jupiter.Wearing a good Pukhraj Stone can reduce the malefic external influences and lessen the problems of married life.
\n\n
<b>Third House:</b> Jupiter being the karka of second house placed in third house makes this second house very strong and the person amasses huge liquid assets. He gains from travel, writing, research, talks, consultations, socializing. People develop a strange love and respect for this person though they envy him also. Money comes easily but still the person has to undergo a lot of struggle in life. He is a very capable negotiator and can handle very difficult situations in cool and composed manner. Even in most difficult times these people can dream big and work to achieve those dreams.
\n\n
In these cases wearing a Light Yellow Sapphire or Treated Pukhraj will be very beneficial.
\n\n
<b>Fourth House:</b> Jupiter in the fourth house is a very good position. It bestows on the person Raj Yoga in its own capacity. Respected like a King, famous, wealthy, charitable, respected even by enemies due to status, business, industry or education. Generally, good natured God fearing people are seen with this combination. These people can not be misled easily. Jupiter is this house gives joy from properties – he gets all possible comforts but suffers from anxiety. General health of these people is good and life is generally comfortable.
\nA strong Pukhraj with a positive Aura is beneficial for these people. Donation of yellow bananas should be a regular ritual for these people.
\n\n
<b>Fifth House:</b> Fifth house is the house of fame and luck. If Jupiter is placed in the Fifth House the person gains from love affairs, has very dutiful and prosperous sons, has a respectable family name. One has an expanding family and respect in the society due to religious bent of mind. Some the person is at the right place in right time and thus gets huge financial gains. One of my clients wanted to get rid of his shares but lost them by the time he got them – the share prices had gone up by 10 times. I have seen that sheer luck picks up these people from nowhere and puts them at a pedestal that amazes every body around.
\nThese people should wear a Big YYellow Sapphire i.e., Pukhraj Stone of 7 to 11 carats in a Gold ring in the index finger of right hand.
\n\n
<b>Sixth House:</b> For Doctors and Lawyers this is a favorable position for Jupiter to be in but for most of the people this is not a very favorable position as it increases the number and strength of the enemies. Too many people try to harm this person, many times, due to no particular reason. The upper abdomen is the weak area of the body for these people. Thus, liver problems and problems in pancreas is often seen. Living in alien lands or with alien people suffering due to cultural problems is often the result of this combination. Medical and legal expenses can be the reason for most of the troubles that this person may face.
\nIn these cases one can wear a Pukhraj Stone only if it is the lord of the 1st, 5th or 9th houses. Otherwise one should make an impression of Shree Yantra and affix a Pukhraj on its lower part and worship it daily so that the negative impact of Saturn can be minimized.
\n\n
<b>Seventh House:</b> Seventh House is the house of marriage and being the tenth from tenth has an impact on profession as well. If Jupiter is placed here it bestows on the person a happy married life and great success in the chosen profession. But due to the nature of Jupiter which increases the karkatwa’s of the house it is placed in, it may lead to more than one marriage or extra marital affairs.This position of Jupiter can also lead to a situation where the person may have a good family life but still have some relations outside the marriage, some disturbances in married life due to these relations will no doubts come up.
\n\n
Wearing a Yellow Sapphire i.e., Pukhraj Stone is always helpful in these cases. It gives a high status in professional life and stable personal life.Natives having this position of Jupiter can wear more than one Pukhraj Stone as rings and as pendants.
\n\n
<b>Eighth House:</b> Jupiter placed in Eighth House is a gives excessive material desires. Married life is good and one gets all kinds of benefits from spouse. Family has wealth but the person has little gains from it. Strong institution and gift of fine arts is visible. The person is blessed with a long life. But early life is marred by troubles due to maternal relations. The financial problems keep on coming up in life even after hard work and complete sincerity. Excessive sexual desire is the results from this combination – if not checked it can lead to social and health problems.
\n\n
Pukhraj Stone i.e., Yellow Sapphire is greatly beneficial for these people. One should wear a Triangular Lemon Topaz of 21 ratti in addition to Pukhraj for best results.
\n\n
<b>Ninth House:</b> Jupiter has a tendency to increase the effects of the House it is placed in. As ninth house is the house of legacy and Bhagya – Jupiter placed here makes a person lucky. Fortune favors him in all its endeavors. He is blessed with long life. He is generous, wealthy and intelligent and gains through foreign lands. He gains respect in the society with little efforts. A basic Raj Yoga is formed by this placement itself. I have seen people with this combination born in poor families getting strong support of fate and leading a very comfortable and respectable lifes. Wearing a Yellow Sapphire i.e., Pukhraj Stone gives them an even stronger Raj Yoga. If unable to afford a Pukhraj then they should wear a Triangular Lemon Topaz of 21 ratti in a panch dhatu pendant.
\n\n
<b>Tenth House:</b> This placement of Jupiter is seen in the charts of IAS officials, Politicians, big Industrialists, Judges and Religious Leaders. If in addition to Jupiter – Sun and Saturn are also well placed then the person will live very close to hall of power – will enjoy the power and position of a person of royal family. Helpful to people, benevolent he is liked by all in the society.
\nGains from the family of birth – money and means of earning money are at one’s disposal from the very beginning of life. So while his counterparts are still struggling he starts earning, accumulating and enjoying wealth. Opponents to these people get weak and ineffective. Victory and glory come to him naturally.
\n\n
Wearing a Pukhraj Stone of high quality along with a Triangular Lemon Topaz of 21 Ratti can turn the further enhance the positive effects of planet Jupiter.
\n\n
<b>Eleventh House:</b> Means of earning are especially strong. To be more precise the word used in Hindu Astrological Texts is ‘If a strong Jupiter is placed in the Eleventh House and is well aspected with the lord of the eleventh house being well placed then the person gets all round gains in life’. Here the sages talk of not just money or professional achievements but of all gains – a happy personal life, respect and fame in the society, good health, a good looking – loving wife, capable and fortunate children, status, wealth, luxuries, valor etc.
\n\n
Saraswati Puja and wearing of Pukhraj Stone improves the results of this placement of Jupiter.
\n\n
<b>Twelfth House:</b> Jupiter placed here gives losses, excessive expenditures, loss of name, health problems – but at the same time spiritual strength. Moksha is achieved by the person whose Jupiter is placed in the Twelfth House. One must remember that Jupiter governs higher moral sentiments and humanitarian qualities. A King under the influence of Jupiter will be a father figure for the subjects.
\n\n
In this position of Jupiter one should worship a Silver Shree Yantra with a Pukhraj Stone fixed on it and chant OM! GRAAM GREEM GROOM SAH GURUVE NAMAH 108 times in a single sitting daily. Along with this wearing a Peela Pukhraj will be beneficial.

    <string name="astro_text">\n\n\t
Gem Stones have a special significance in Vedic Astrology. Since time immemorial Gem Stones have been used to liberate the problems caused by planets. In those days only the kings and influential people used to wear Gem Stones as recommended by their Astrologers and get the benefits of wearing suitable Gem Stones but now a day’s anyone can wear Gem Stones and get the benefits from the same.
\n\n\t
Every planet traverses in its orbit. During its movement, it gives out powerful cosmic vibrations. The force of these vibrations varies from planet to planet. The radiating energies travel through the electromagnetic and heat fields surrounding the Earth’s atmosphere, in order to reach the human beings residing there. They are in the form of rays. These rays effects living beings negatively or positively. This means that planetary positions, as well as their interactions with one another, impact us throughout our lives.
\n\n\t
The planets rule and resonate with all Gem Stones knowing which planets are giving favourable karma, and which are presenting challenges is essential in choosing beneficial Gem Stones for healing or personal development. This is the reason Gem Stones can affect different people in vastly different ways.
\n\n\t
Planetary rulership of the Gem Stone and how well that planet is positioned in our personal chart, is the primary indicator of that Gem Stone’s effect on us. Wearing or carrying the appropriate quality Gem Stone of our most favourable planets will considerably enhance its areas of influence. 
\n\n\t
Gem Stones are worn to ward off the negative influences of planets as their vibrations corresponds to unique planets. Astrology finds out the suitable gem Stones for a person through astrological calculations that ensure overall growth and well being. Accurate Gem Stones along with their correct weight and wearing method are mandatory to arouse the desired qualities of a person that ensure success.
\n\n\t
Vedic Astrologers call on the power of Indian gods and planets to predict the future and help people to avoid the potential negative impact of the planets in all aspects of their lives. According to these astrologers certain gems can prevent or promote the effects of the planets and by wearing appropriate stones, people can use the power of the planets in order to achieve success and maintain good health.
\n\n\t
Suitable stone for a person at a given time depends on the radiant energy that each planet emits. This energy affects differently to each person according to his zodiac sign and the position of the planets in his horoscope. Sometimes the impact is favorable but sometimes planetary conditions may change and have a negative impact on your life. In this case, stone are worn to counteract the negative constellation.
\n\n\t
While the good leads to more benefits in your current life, the bad brings punishments. If specifically, recommended Gem Stones are worn for particular duration\'s or for an entire lifetime, they serve to reduce the negative effects of your previous and current karma\'s. It goes without saying that the gemstones must be natural, untreated and flawless.
